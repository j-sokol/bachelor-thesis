\abstractEN{This thesis deals with research and deployment of provisioning frameworks for bare metal servers. Goal of this thesis is to chose one of those frameworks, deploy it and with changes use it in production. The choosing criteria are: open-source software for practical and economical reasons, comunity behind framework and support for installed operating system (there has to be at least OS CentOS and Debian). Based on analysis in the first chapter was chosen framework Foreman, that suits criteria the best -- simple and usable graphical web interface, support for multiple separated local area networks and an option to change configuration of installed systems fast. Another chapter shows deployment of Foreman framework. This thesis also includes plugin for Foreman to show graphs from rrd data source (with use of Collectd Graph Panel). Ansible playbooks for simple deployment of Foreman servers are also included. }
